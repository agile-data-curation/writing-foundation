\
Current research data practices typically fall along a continuum between highly engineered systems and ad-hoc practices. In recognition of the increasing investment in and importance of research data as an asset for doing research, evaluating current research results, and as a resource for new research, funding agencies, publishers and some research teams have instituted research data management practices aligned with a wide variety of data life cycle models that embody a circular process of steps that include such activities as creation, assessment, documentation, use, preservation, discovery and reuse. While these data lifecycle approaches are well aligned with the documentation and preservation of research data - particularly as they have been primarily developed by organizations with a mandate to provide for the preservation of data, this linear (or more appropriately cyclical) model does not necessarily focus on the level of effort required throughout the processes embodied in the lifecycle. The agile data curation conceptual model outlined in this presentation provides a draft set of values and principles that are inspired by the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the associated set of principles that were developed in alignment with the values defined therein. The research team is seeking feedback from the community on the draft values and principles that will be presented, case studies that exemplify them, and the design pattern strategy that has been developed accelerate the adoption of practices that are aligned with the values and principles defined.}
