\
Current research data management and curation practices can be described as falling along a continuum between highly engineered systems and ad-hoc practices. In recognition of the increasing investment in and importance of research data as an asset for doing research, evaluating current research results, and as a resource for new research, funding agencies, publishers and some research teams have instituted research data management practices aligned with a wide variety of data life cycle models that embody a circular process of steps that include such activities as creation, assessment, documentation, use, preservation, discovery and reuse. While these data lifecycle approaches are well aligned with the documentation and preservation of research data - particularly as they have been primarily developed by organizations with a mandate to provide for the preservation of data, this linear (or more appropriately cyclical) model does not necessarily focus on the level of effort required throughout the processes embodied in the lifecycle or the lowering of barriers to subsequent reuse. The agile data curation conceptual model outlined herein provides is intended to propose as a starting point for community consideration a core set of values, principles and in the long-run recommended practices in the form of research data management and curation design patterns that may be used to define project-specific activities that are likely to both meet the immediate needs of data producing research projects while also maximizing the net value of data produced by those projects for future research, education, and applications. }
