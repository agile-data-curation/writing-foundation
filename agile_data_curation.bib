  abstract = {Motivation: Phylogenetic estimates from published studies can be archived using general platforms like Dryad (Vision, 2010) or TreeBASE (Sanderson et al., 1994). Such services fulfill a crucial role in ensuring transparency and reproducibility in phylogenetic research. However, digital tree data files often require some editing (e.g. rerooting) to improve the accuracy and reusability of the phylogenetic statements. Furthermore, establishing the mapping between tip labels used in a tree and taxa in a single common taxonomy dramatically improves the ability of other researchers to reuse phylogenetic estimates. As the process of curating a published phylogenetic estimate is not error-free, retaining a full record of the provenance of edits to a tree is crucial for openness, allowing editors to receive credit for their work and making errors introduced during curation easier to correct. Results: Here, we report the development of software infrastructure to support the open curation of phylogenetic data by the community of biologists. The backend of the system provides an interface for the standard database operations of creating, reading, updating and deleting records by making commits to a git repository. The record of the history of edits to a tree is preserved by git's version control features. Hosting this data store on GitHub provides open access to the data store using tools familiar to many developers. We have deployed a server running the 'phylesystem-api', which wraps the interactions with git and GitHub. The Open Tree of Life project has also developed and deployed a JavaScript application that uses the phylesystem-api and other web services to enable input and curation of published phylogenetic statements.},

  abstract = {Long-term monitoring and research projects are essential to understand ecological change and the effectiveness of management activities. An inherent characteristic of long-term projects is the need for consistent data collection over time, requiring rigorous attention to data management and quality assurance. Recent papers have provided broad recommendations for data management; however, practitioners need more detailed guidance and examples. We present general yet detailed guidance for the development of comprehensive, concise, and effective data management for monitoring projects. The guidance is presented as a graded approach, matching the scale of data management to the needs of the organization and the complexity of the project. We address the following topics: roles and responsibilities; consistent and precise data collection; calibration of field crews and instrumentation; management of tabular, photographic, video, and sound data; data completeness and quality; development of metadata; archiving data; and evaluation of existing data from other sources. This guidance will help practitioners execute effective data management, thereby, improving the quality and usability of data for meeting project objectives as well as broader meta-analysis and macrosystem ecology research. © 2015 The Authors.

So-called service-oriented architectures define standard interfaces and protocols that allow developers to encapsulate information tools as services that clients can access without knowledge of, or control over, their internal workings. Thus, tools formerly accessible only to the specialist can be made available to all; previously manual data-processing and analysis tasks can be automated by having services access services. Such service-oriented approaches to science are already being applied successfully, in some cases at substantial scales, but much more effort is required before these approaches are applied routinely across many disciplines. Grid technologies can accelerate the development and adoption of service-oriented science by enabling a separation of concerns between discipline-specific content and domain-independent software and hardware infrastructure.},

In this article, we used a recent project evaluating changes in Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) growth, condition, and recruitment in the Great Lakes as a case study to illustrate how thoughtful data management approaches can enhance and improve research. Data management best practices described include dedicating personnel to data curation, setting data standards, building a relational database, managing data updates, checking for and trapping errors, extracting data, documenting data sets, and coordinating with project collaborators. The data management actions taken ultimately resulted in a rich body of scientific publication and a robust database available for future studies. Investing in data management allowed this project to serve as a model for taking the first steps toward a common goal of sharing, documenting, and preserving data that are collected and reported during the scientific research process.},

We argue that constructive deviance is an umbrella term that encompasses several different behaviors, including taking charge, creative performance, expressing voice, whistle-blowing, extra-role behaviors, prosocial behaviors, prosocial rule breaking, counter-role behaviors, and issue selling. Using the three common mechanisms underlying constructive deviance to organize our review (intrinsic motivation, felt obligation, and psychological empowerment), we provide an emergent model that integrates extant empirical work on the antecedents of constructive deviance. We conclude by discussing issues for future research, such as examining obstacles, outcomes, and unexplored mechanism dynamics associated with constructive deviance.},

The article gives the background about how the positive deviance technique came to be, and how it is delivering significant solutions to social problems that had been seen as intractable. It describes how the approach has been used in organizations such as Merck and HP to optimize organizational knowledge and learning, and in a current initiative to reduce MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) infections in hospitals across the USA. Jane Lewis then demonstrates how learning from these exercises mirrored and informed the project at Hertfordshire and the results delivered, both in terms of culture change and improved performance. She reflects on the links between this approach and current thinking in the social sciences, and looks forward to new projects that are just beginning.},

Four tests are used to determine whether an entity qualifies as a complex adaptive system: (1) it must be comprised of many agents acting in parallel; (2) it continuously shuffles these building blocks and generates multiple levels of organization and structure; (3) it is subject to the second law of thermodynamics; (4) it exhibits a capacity for pattern recognition and employs this to anticipate the future and learn to recognize the anticipation of seasonal change.  Treating organizations as complex adaptive systems provides insight into the nature of strategic work.

Why are big companies that seem to have it all so often vulnerable to attack by small upstarts? Traditional management thinking seems unable to offer convincing answers. To find out why, this article traces the roots of current management frameworks back to neoclassical economics, which in turn owes its origins to nineteenth-century energy physics and its concept of closed equilibrium systems. While the neoclassical model was a reasonable approximation to the agricultural and manufacturing economy of its day, it runs into trouble in a world where innovation, change, and uncertainty are the rule. Economists and managers need a new model if they are to understand the workings of today's economies and markets. This article describes a new economics based on complex adaptive systems, and explores the challenge this poses for companies: to be both a successful competitor and a smart evolver.},

  abstract = {In the early 1970s when Canon took its first halting steps in reprographics, the idea of a fledgling Japanese company challenging Xerox seemed preposterous. Fifteen years later, it matched the U.S. giant in global unit market share. The basis for Canon's success? A different approach to making strategy--an approach that emphasizes an organization's resourcefulness more than the resources it currently controls. As "strategy" has blossomed, the competitiveness of Western companies has withered. Familiar concepts like strategic fit and competitive advantage can foster a static approach to competition. Familiar techniques like portfolio planning and competitor analysis lead to strategies that rivals can easily decode. The sum total is a pathology of surrender that leads many managers to abandon businesses instead of building them. Canon and other world-class competitors make strategy in a different way: on the basis of strategic intent. They begin with a goal that exceeds the company's present grasp and existing resources: "Beat Xerox," "Encircle Caterpillar." Then they rally the organization to close the gap by setting challenges that focus employees' efforts in the near to medium term: "Build a personal copier to sell for \$1,000." "Cut product development time by 75 \%." Year after year, they emphasize competitive innovation: building a portfolio of competitive advantages; searching markets for "loose bricks" that rivals have left underdefended; changing the terms of competitive engagement to avoid playing by the leader's rules. The result is a global leadership position and an approach to competition that has reduced larger, stronger Western rivals to an endless game of catch-up ball.

  abstract = {How often does the strategic planning process start with senior executives asking what the rest of the organization can teach them about the future? Not often enough, argues Gary Hamel. In many companies, strategy making is an elitist procedure and "strategy" consists of nothing more than following the industry's rules. But more and more companies, intent on overturning the industrial order, are rewriting those rules. What can industry incumbents do? Either surrender the future to revolutionary challengers or revolutionize the way their companies create strategy. What is needed is not a tweak to the traditional strategic planning process, Hamel says, but a new philosophical foundation: strategy is revolution. Hamel offers ten principles to help a company think about the challenge of creating truly revolutionary strategies. Perhaps the most fundamental principle is that so-called strategic planning doesn't produce true strategic innovation. The traditional planning process is little more than a rote procedure in which deeply held assumptions and industry conventions are reinforced rather than challenged. Such a process harnesses only a tiny proportion of an organization's creative potential.          If there is to be any hope of industry revolution, senior managers must give up their monopoly on the creation of strategy. They must embrace a truly democratic process that can give voice to the revolutionaries that exist in every company. If senior managers are unwilling to do this, employees must become strategy activists. The opportunities for industry revolution are mostly unexplored. One thing is certain: if you don't let the revolutionaries challenge you from within, they will eventually challenge you from without--in the marketplace.},

The concept of positive deviance (PD), which highlights uncommon practices that reduce risk in low-resource communities, has been effective in community mobilization and programming to improve health outcomes. We present a protocol for extending the concept to analysis of existing public health data. The protocol includes assessing whether PD fits the situation, identifying positive deviants, and identifying behaviors associated with positive deviants' healthy outcomes. Analyzing existing datasets from a PD perspective may aid public health nurses in efforts to reduce health disparities. The effectiveness of our protocol will be clarified in future research.},

  shorttitle = {Positive Deviance},
  abstract = {Background
There is a paucity of data evaluating whether positive deviance (PD) can sustain improvement in hand hygiene compliance.
Methods
An observational study comparing the effect of PD on compliance with hand hygiene was conducted in two 20-bed step-down units (SDUs) at a private tertiary care hospital. In a 3-month baseline period (April-June 2008), hand hygiene counts were performed by electronic handwashing counters. Between July 1, 2008, and November 30, 2009, (East SDU) and between September 30, 2008, and December 2009 (West SDU), PD was applied in both units.
Results
There was more than a 2-fold difference in the number of alcohol gel aliquots dispensed per month from April 2008 (before PD) to November 2009 (last month in PD) in the East SDU. There was also a 2-fold difference in the number of alcohol gel aliquots dispensed per month from September 2008 (before PD) to December 2009 (last month in PD) in the West SDU. The difference in the rate of health care‒associated infections (HAIs) between the baseline period and 2009 was statistically significant in the East SDU (5.8 vs 2.8 per 1,000 device-days; P = .008) and in the West SDU (3.7 vs 1.7 per 1,000 device-days; P = .023).
Conclusions
PD was responsible for a sustained improvement in hand hygiene in the inpatient setting and was associated with a decrease in the incidence of device-associated HAIs.},

In Experiment 1, ingroup positive deviates who made group attributions were generally evaluated more favorably than ingroup positive deviates who made individual attributions. There was also evidence that the positive deviates' attribution style influenced group and self-evaluations. Evaluations of outgroup positive deviates were not influenced by their attribution style. In Experiment 2, an ingroup positive deviate who was successful and attributed that success to the group was upgraded relative to an ingroup positive deviate who made individual attributions. Group evaluations were also higher when the positive deviate made group attributions. This pattern did not emerge when the positive deviate failed. The results are discussed from a social identity perspective.},

Seeking to explain why some organizations practice positive environmental deviance while others do not, we locate our inquiry on the board of directors—the organizational body that interprets external issues and guides organizational response. We find a strong correlation between positive deviance and the past environmental experience of board directors and the centrality of the organization within field-level networks. Organizations located on the periphery of the network or whose boards possess a high level of environmental experience are more likely to deviate in positive ways. Our conclusions contribute to multiple literatures in behavioral and environmental governance, the role of filtering and enaction in the process of institutional conformity and change, and the mechanisms behind proactive environmental protection strategies within business.

  doi = {10.1109/IEEM.2013.6962584},
  abstract = {Corporate efforts to improve the bottom line traditionally focus on shortcoming and issues. A comprehensive set of analytical tools and methodologies (e.g., Lean Management, Six Sigma) have been developed and are deployed in attempts to fix identified problems. However, little guidance is available on how to actually come up with improved organisational and process designs. Organisations tend to rely on approaches such as brainstorming that do not lead to consistent and reliable outcomes. It is proposed to benefit from conducting a dedicated study on internal sources for business improvement. This so-called positive deviance approach utilises internal best practices and converts successful, but hidden best practices into widely deployed, corporate practices. The paper develops an approach to identify exceptional performers and map their behaviors and activities which made them successful. The objective was to identify practical quick wins which can be implemented through existing account auditing activities.},

  abstract = {The article reports on developing a positive deviance as a tool for organizational change. Enterpriser Richard Pascale and Jerry Sternin developed a different approach to bringing about organizational change. They refer to their approach as "positive deviance." They believe the answer to successful change management lies in finding individuals or groups who already are doing things in a radically better way. The process they advocate seeks to build upon the strategies of these positive deviants. Rather than identifying the problems and creating a solution, a solution is found and worked backward to solve the problem.},

  abstract = {Digital data are accumulating rapidly, yet issues relating to data production remain unexamined. Data sharing efforts in particular are nascent, disunited and incomplete. We investigate the development of data products tailored for diverse communities with differing knowledge bases. We explore not the technical aspects of how, why, or where data are made available, but rather the socio-scientific aspects influencing what data products are created and made available for use. These products differ from compact data summaries often published in journals. We report on development by a national data center of two data collections describing the changing polar environment. One collection characterizes sea ice products derived from satellite remote sensing data and development unfolds over three decades. The second collection characterizes the Greenland Ice Sheet melt where development of an initial collection of data products over a period of several months was informed by insights gained from earlier experience. In documenting the generation of these two collections, a data product development cycle supported by a data product team is identified as key to mobilizing scientific knowledge. The collections reveal a co-evolution of data products and designated communities where community interest may be triggered by events such as environmental disturbance and new modes of communication. These examples of data product development in practice illustrate knowledge mobilization in the earth sciences; the collections create a bridge between data producers and a growing number of audiences interested in making evidence-based decisions.},

  abstract = {Summary
Policies ensuring that research data are available on public archives are increasingly being implemented at the government [1], funding agency [2–4], and journal [5, 6] level. These policies are predicated on the idea that authors are poor stewards of their data, particularly over the long term [7], and indeed many studies have found that authors are often unable or unwilling to share their data [8–11]. However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested data sets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a data set being extant fell by 17\% per year. In addition, the odds that we could find a working e-mail address for the first, last, or corresponding author fell by 7\% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives.},
