  abstract = {Motivation: Phylogenetic estimates from published studies can be archived using general platforms like Dryad (Vision, 2010) or TreeBASE (Sanderson et al., 1994). Such services fulfill a crucial role in ensuring transparency and reproducibility in phylogenetic research. However, digital tree data files often require some editing (e.g. rerooting) to improve the accuracy and reusability of the phylogenetic statements. Furthermore, establishing the mapping between tip labels used in a tree and taxa in a single common taxonomy dramatically improves the ability of other researchers to reuse phylogenetic estimates. As the process of curating a published phylogenetic estimate is not error-free, retaining a full record of the provenance of edits to a tree is crucial for openness, allowing editors to receive credit for their work and making errors introduced during curation easier to correct. Results: Here, we report the development of software infrastructure to support the open curation of phylogenetic data by the community of biologists. The backend of the system provides an interface for the standard database operations of creating, reading, updating and deleting records by making commits to a git repository. The record of the history of edits to a tree is preserved by git's version control features. Hosting this data store on GitHub provides open access to the data store using tools familiar to many developers. We have deployed a server running the 'phylesystem-api', which wraps the interactions with git and GitHub. The Open Tree of Life project has also developed and deployed a JavaScript application that uses the phylesystem-api and other web services to enable input and curation of published phylogenetic statements.},

  abstract = {Long-term monitoring and research projects are essential to understand ecological change and the effectiveness of management activities. An inherent characteristic of long-term projects is the need for consistent data collection over time, requiring rigorous attention to data management and quality assurance. Recent papers have provided broad recommendations for data management; however, practitioners need more detailed guidance and examples. We present general yet detailed guidance for the development of comprehensive, concise, and effective data management for monitoring projects. The guidance is presented as a graded approach, matching the scale of data management to the needs of the organization and the complexity of the project. We address the following topics: roles and responsibilities; consistent and precise data collection; calibration of field crews and instrumentation; management of tabular, photographic, video, and sound data; data completeness and quality; development of metadata; archiving data; and evaluation of existing data from other sources. This guidance will help practitioners execute effective data management, thereby, improving the quality and usability of data for meeting project objectives as well as broader meta-analysis and macrosystem ecology research. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

So-called service-oriented architectures define standard interfaces and protocols that allow developers to encapsulate information tools as services that clients can access without knowledge of, or control over, their internal workings. Thus, tools formerly accessible only to the specialist can be made available to all; previously manual data-processing and analysis tasks can be automated by having services access services. Such service-oriented approaches to science are already being applied successfully, in some cases at substantial scales, but much more effort is required before these approaches are applied routinely across many disciplines. Grid technologies can accelerate the development and adoption of service-oriented science by enabling a separation of concerns between discipline-specific content and domain-independent software and hardware infrastructure.},

Data management best practices described include dedicating personnel to data curation, setting data standards, building a relational database, managing data updates, checking for and trapping errors, extracting data, documenting data sets, and coordinating with project collaborators. The data management actions taken ultimately resulted in a rich body of scientific publication and a robust database available for future studies. Investing in data management allowed this project to serve as a model for taking the first steps toward a common goal of sharing, documenting, and preserving data that are collected and reported during the scientific research process.},

Why are big companies that seem to have it all so often vulnerable to attack by small upstarts? Traditional management thinking seems unable to offer convincing answers. To find out why, this article traces the roots of current management frameworks back to neoclassical economics, which in turn owes its origins to nineteenth-century energy physics and its concept of closed equilibrium systems. While the neoclassical model was a reasonable approximation to the agricultural and manufacturing economy of its day, it runs into trouble in a world where innovation, change, and uncertainty are the rule. Economists and managers need a new model if they are to understand the workings of today's economies and markets.

We argue that constructive deviance is an umbrella term that encompasses several different behaviors, including taking charge, creative performance, expressing voice, whistle-blowing, extra-role behaviors, prosocial behaviors, prosocial rule breaking, counter-role behaviors, and issue selling. Using the three common mechanisms underlying constructive deviance to organize our review (intrinsic motivation, felt obligation, and psychological empowerment), we provide an emergent model that integrates extant empirical work on the antecedents of constructive deviance. We conclude by discussing issues for future research, such as examining obstacles, outcomes, and unexplored mechanism dynamics associated with constructive deviance.},

The concept of positive deviance (PD), which highlights uncommon practices that reduce risk in low-resource communities, has been effective in community mobilization and programming to improve health outcomes. We present a protocol for extending the concept to analysis of existing public health data. The protocol includes assessing whether PD fits the situation, identifying positive deviants, and identifying behaviors associated with positive deviants' healthy outcomes. Analyzing existing datasets from a PD perspective may aid public health nurses in efforts to reduce health disparities. The effectiveness of our protocol will be clarified in future research.},

Enterpriser Richard Pascale and Jerry Sternin developed a different approach to bringing about organizational change. They refer to their approach as "positive deviance." They believe the answer to successful change management lies in finding individuals or groups who already are doing things in a radically better way. The process they advocate seeks to build upon the strategies of these positive deviants. Rather than identifying the problems and creating a solution, a solution is found and worked backward to solve the problem.},

  abstract = {In the early 1970s when Canon took its first halting steps in reprographics, the idea of a fledgling Japanese company challenging Xerox seemed preposterous. Fifteen years later, it matched the U.S. giant in global unit market share. The basis for Canon's success? A different approach to making strategy--an approach that emphasizes an organization's resourcefulness more than the resources it currently controls. As "strategy" has blossomed, the competitiveness of Western companies has withered. Familiar concepts like strategic fit and competitive advantage can foster a static approach to competition. Familiar techniques like portfolio planning and competitor analysis lead to strategies that rivals can easily decode. The sum total is a pathology of surrender that leads many managers to abandon businesses instead of building them. Canon and other world-class competitors make strategy in a different way: on the basis of strategic intent. They begin with a goal that exceeds the company's present grasp and existing resources: "Beat Xerox," "Encircle Caterpillar." Then they rally the organization to close the gap by setting challenges that focus employees' efforts in the near to medium term: "Build a personal copier to sell for \$1,000." "Cut product development time by 75 \%." Year after year, they emphasize competitive innovation: building a portfolio of competitive advantages; searching markets for "loose bricks" that rivals have left underdefended; changing the terms of competitive engagement to avoid playing by the leader's rules. The result is a global leadership position and an approach to competition that has reduced larger, stronger Western rivals to an endless game of catch-up ball.

  abstract = {Background
There is a paucity of data evaluating whether positive deviance (PD) can sustain improvement in hand hygiene compliance.
Methods
An observational study comparing the effect of PD on compliance with hand hygiene was conducted in two 20-bed step-down units (SDUs) at a private tertiary care hospital. In a 3-month baseline period (April-June 2008), hand hygiene counts were performed by electronic handwashing counters. Between July 1, 2008, and November 30, 2009, (East SDU) and between September 30, 2008, and December 2009 (West SDU), PD was applied in both units.
Results
There was more than a 2-fold difference in the number of alcohol gel aliquots dispensed per month from April 2008 (before PD) to November 2009 (last month in PD) in the East SDU. There was also a 2-fold difference in the number of alcohol gel aliquots dispensed per month from September 2008 (before PD) to December 2009 (last month in PD) in the West SDU. The difference in the rate of health care‒associated infections (HAIs) between the baseline period and 2009 was statistically significant in the East SDU (5.8 vs 2.8 per 1,000 device-days; P = .008) and in the West SDU (3.7 vs 1.7 per 1,000 device-days; P = .023).
Conclusions
PD was responsible for a sustained improvement in hand hygiene in the inpatient setting and was associated with a decrease in the incidence of device-associated HAIs.},

We argue that ingroup positive deviates who make group attributions help enhance the ingroup's image and thus attract favorable evaluations. In Experiment 1, ingroup positive deviates who made group attributions were generally evaluated more favorably than ingroup positive deviates who made individual attributions. There was also evidence that the positive deviates' attribution style influenced group and self-evaluations. Evaluations of outgroup positive deviates were not influenced by their attribution style. In Experiment 2, an ingroup positive deviate who was successful and attributed that success to the group was upgraded relative to an ingroup positive deviate who made individual attributions. Group evaluations were also higher when the positive deviate made group attributions. This pattern did not emerge when the positive deviate failed. The results are discussed from a social identity perspective.},

Four tests are used to determine whether an entity qualifies as a complex adaptive system: (1) it must be comprised of many agents acting in parallel; (2) it continuously shuffles these building blocks and generates multiple levels of organization and structure; (3) it is subject to the second law of thermodynamics; (4) it exhibits a capacity for pattern recognition and employs this to anticipate the future and learn to recognize the anticipation of seasonal change.  Treating organizations as complex adaptive systems provides insight into the nature of strategic work.

  abstract = {How often does the strategic planning process start with senior executives asking what the rest of the organization can teach them about the future? Not often enough, argues Gary Hamel. In many companies, strategy making is an elitist procedure and "strategy" consists of nothing more than following the industry's rules. But more and more companies, intent on overturning the industrial order, are rewriting those rules. What can industry incumbents do? Either surrender the future to revolutionary challengers or revolutionize the way their companies create strategy. What is needed is not a tweak to the traditional strategic planning process, Hamel says, but a new philosophical foundation: strategy is revolution. Hamel offers ten principles to help a company think about the challenge of creating truly revolutionary strategies. Perhaps the most fundamental principle is that so-called strategic planning doesn't produce true strategic innovation. The traditional planning process is little more than a rote procedure in which deeply held assumptions and industry conventions are reinforced rather than challenged. Such a process harnesses only a tiny proportion of an organization's creative potential.          If there is to be any hope of industry revolution, senior managers must give up their monopoly on the creation of strategy. They must embrace a truly democratic process that can give voice to the revolutionaries that exist in every company. If senior managers are unwilling to do this, employees must become strategy activists. The opportunities for industry revolution are mostly unexplored. One thing is certain: if you don't let the revolutionaries challenge you from within, they will eventually challenge you from without--in the marketplace.},

Seeking to explain why some organizations practice positive environmental deviance while others do not, we locate our inquiry on the board of directors\textemdash{}the organizational body that interprets external issues and guides organizational response. We find a strong correlation between positive deviance and the past environmental experience of board directors and the centrality of the organization within field-level networks. Organizations located on the periphery of the network or whose boards possess a high level of environmental experience are more likely to deviate in positive ways. Our conclusions contribute to multiple literatures in behavioral and environmental governance, the role of filtering and enaction in the process of institutional conformity and change, and the mechanisms behind proactive environmental protection strategies within business.

Organisations tend to rely on approaches such as brainstorming that do not lead to consistent and reliable outcomes. It is proposed to benefit from conducting a dedicated study on internal sources for business improvement. This so-called positive deviance approach utilises internal best practices and converts successful, but hidden best practices into widely deployed, corporate practices.

We investigate the development of data products tailored for diverse communities with differing knowledge bases. We explore not the technical aspects of how, why, or where data are made available, but rather the socio-scientific aspects influencing what data products are created and made available for use. These products differ from compact data summaries often published in journals. We report on development by a national data center of two data collections describing the changing polar environment. One collection characterizes sea ice products derived from satellite remote sensing data and development unfolds over three decades. The second collection characterizes the Greenland Ice Sheet melt where development of an initial collection of data products over a period of several months was informed by insights gained from earlier experience. In documenting the generation of these two collections, a data product development cycle supported by a data product team is identified as key to mobilizing scientific knowledge. The collections reveal a co-evolution of data products and designated communities where community interest may be triggered by events such as environmental disturbance and new modes of communication. These examples of data product development in practice illustrate knowledge mobilization in the earth sciences; the collections create a bridge between data producers and a growing number of audiences interested in making evidence-based decisions.},

It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. Agile itself has never defined any specific methods to achieve this, but many have grown up as a result and have been recognized as being 'Agile'.
The Manifesto for Agile Software Development, also known as the Agile Manifesto, was first proclaimed in 2001. The manifesto came out of the DSDM Consortium in 1994, although its roots go back to the mid 1980s at DuPont and texts by James Martin and James Kerr et al.},

  abstract = {Summary
Policies ensuring that research data are available on public archives are increasingly being implemented at the government [1], funding agency [2\textendash{}4], and journal [5, 6] level. These policies are predicated on the idea that authors are poor stewards of their data, particularly over the long term [7], and indeed many studies have found that authors are often unable or unwilling to share their data [8\textendash{}11]. However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested data sets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a data set being extant fell by 17\% per year. In addition, the odds that we could find a working e-mail address for the first, last, or corresponding author fell by 7\% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives.},

  abstract = {The term ``artifact'' currently does not have a formal definition within the domain of cyber/digital forensics, resulting in a lack of standardized reporting, linguistic understanding between professionals, and efficiency. In this paper we propose a new definition based on a survey we conducted, literature usage, prior definitions of the word itself, and similarities with archival science. This definition includes required fields that all artifacts must have and encompasses the notion of curation. Thus, we propose using a new term \textendash{} curated forensic artifact (CuFA) \textendash{} to address items which have been cleared for entry into a CuFA database (one implementation, the Artifact Genome Project, abbreviated as AGP, is under development and briefly outlined). An ontological model encapsulates these required fields while utilizing a lower-level taxonomic schema. We use the Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX) project due to its rising popularity and rigorous classifications of forensic objects. Additionally, we suggest some improvements on its integration into our model and identify higher-level location categories to illustrate tracing an object from creation through investigative leads. Finally, a step-wise procedure for researching and logging CuFAs is devised to accompany the model.},

  abstract = {One of the primary outputs of the scientific enterprise is data, but many institutions such as libraries that are charged with preserving and disseminating scholarly output have largely ignored this form of documentation of scholarly activity. This paper focuses on a particularly troublesome class of data, termed dark data. ``Dark data'' is not carefully indexed and stored so it becomes nearly invisible to scientists and other potential users and therefore is more likely to remain underutilized and eventually lost. The article discusses how the concepts from long-tail economics can be used to understand potential solutions for better curation of this data. The paper describes why this data is critical to scientific progress, some of the properties of this data, as well as some social and technical barriers to proper management of this class of data. Many potentially useful institutional, social, and technical solutions are under development and are introduced in the last sections of the paper, but these solutions are largely unproven and require additional research and development.},

  abstract = {Web services have been used for many years. In this time, developers and architects have encountered a number of recurring design challenges related to their usage, and have learned that certain service design approaches work better than others to solve certain problems. In Service Design Patterns, Rob Daigneau codifies proven design solutions for web services that follow the REST architectural style or leverage the SOAP/WSDL specifications. This catalogue identifies the fundamental topics in web service design and lists the common design patterns for each topic. All patterns identify the context in which they may be used, explain the constituent design elements, and explore the relative strengths and trade-offs. Code examples are provided to help you better understand how the patterns work but are kept general so that you can see how the solutions may be applied to disparate technologies that will inevitably change in the years to come. This book will help readers answer the following questions: How do you create a web service API, what are the common API styles, and when should a particular style be used? How can clients and web services communicate, and what are the foundations for creating complex conversations in which multiple parties exchange data over extended periods of time? What are the options for implementing web service logic, and when should a particular approach be used? How can clients become less coupled to the underlying systems used by a service? How can information about a web service be discovered? How can generic functions like authentication, validation, caching, and logging be supported on the client or service? What changes to a service cause clients to break? What are the common ways to version a service? How can web services be designed to support the continuing evolution of business logic without forcing clients to constantly upgrade? This book is an invaluable resource for enterprise architects, solution architects, and developers who use web services to create enterprise IT applications, commercial or open source products, and Software as a Service (SaaS) products that leverage emerging Cloud platforms.},

The integration of product and process models in a unified data model could provide the means by which information could be shared between High Energy Physics (HEP) groups throughout the system lifecycle from design through to production. Recently attempts have been made to integrate these two separate views of systems through identifying common data models. This paper relates description-driven systems to multi-layer architectures through the CRISTAL project and reveals where existing design patterns facilitate the integration of product and process models, where patterns are missing or require enrichment for integration. It reports on the construction of a so-called description-driven system which integrates Product Data Management (PDM) and Workflow Management (WfM) models through a common meta-model.},

The degradation decreases the income generated by the system. To maintain revenue stream and prevent the loss of revenue, the system is inspected according to a Markov-modulated Poisson process. It is assumed that each inspection at time t incurs a time dependent cost. Each inspection improves the system health and therefore the degradation level jumps to a less deteriorated state. In absence of inspections, the system state is prone to shift to a more deteriorated state with a constant rate. The problem is to determine an optimal operating (stopping) time which truly balances some flow of income and increasing costs due to inspections, and so maximizes the expected gain of the proposed policy. To demonstrate the applicability of the explored approach and its effectiveness, some numerical results are provided.},

  abstract = {Reliability is an important engineering requirement for consistently delivering acceptable product performance through time. As time progresses, the product may fail due to time phenomena such as time-dependent operating conditions, component degradation, etc. The degradation of reliability with time may increase the lifecycle cost due to potential warranty costs, repairs and loss of market share. In design for lifecycle cost and preventive maintenance, we must account for product quality, and time-dependent reliability. Quality is a measure of our confidence that the product conforms to specifications as it leaves the factory. Reliability depends on 1) the probability that the system will perform its intended function successfully for a specified interval of time, and 2) on the probability that the system response will not exceed an objectionable by the customer or operator, threshold for a certain time period. Quality is time-independent, and reliability is time-dependent. This paper presents a methodology to determine the optimal design and preventive maintenance of time-dependent, multi-response systems, by minimizing the cost during the life of the product. The lifecycle cost includes a production, an inspection, and an expected variable cost. All costs depend on quality and/or reliability. A roller clutch example highlights the design methodology for lifecycle cost.},

In a continuous-time LQ prediction problem with a costly rate of information acquisition-processing, the optimal prediction evolves smoothly, but jumps at an optimally chosen frequency, when fresh information accrues. A more volatile and persistent target raises the information rate required to maintain a sampling frequency. This cost-effect moderates and may even reverse the benefit-effect on the value of information, so optimal inertia is unresponsive to and nonmonotonic in the predictability of the environment. Conventional models with a fixed cost per observation imply no such cost-effect, so inertia rises quickly in the predictability of the environment.},

  abstract = {A time-dependent version of the cost-loss ratio situation is described and the optimal use and economic value of meteorological information are investigated in this decision-making problem. The time-dependent situation is motivated by a decision maker who contemplates postponing the protect/do not protect decision in anticipation of obtaining more accurate forecasts at some later time (i.e., shorter lead time), but who also recognizes that the cost of protection will increase as lead time decreases. Imperfect categorical forecasts, calibrated according to past performance, constitute the information of primary interest. Optimal decisions are based on minimizing expected expense and the value of information is measured relative to the expected expense associated with climatological information. Accuracy and cost of protection are modeled as exponentially decreasing functions of lead time, and time-dependent expressions for expected expense and value of information are derived. An optimal lead time is identified that corresponds to the time at which the expected expense associated with imperfect forecasts attains its minimum value. The effects of the values of the parameters in the accuracy and cost-of-protection models on expected expense, optimal lead time, and forecast value are examined. Moreover, the optimal lead time is shown to differ in some cases from the lead time at which the economic value of imperfect forecasts is maximized. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the various results. The implications of these results are discussed and some possible extensions of this work are suggested.},

  abstract = {Environmental monitoring and research programs depend on being able to store, retrieve, and understand data that are collected over long periods. However, long-term accessibility of high quality data is hindered by "data entropy," the natural tendency for data to degrade in information content over time. Two approaches are necessary to impede data entropy: developing comprehensive documentation (i.e., metadata) for the data and contributing both the data and metadata to secure data archives. Tn this chapter, I discuss data archives, identify metadata content and format standards relevant to spatial and non-geospatial data, and present examples of several North American data archives. The long-term, integrated inventory and monitoring of forest ecosystem resources depend on the availability of high quality metadata and archives for supporting data and metadata storage and retrieval.},

  abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) has emerged as one of the largest collections of interlinked datasets on the web. In order to benefit from this mine of data, one needs to access to descriptive information about each dataset (or metadata). This information can be used to delay data entropy, enhance dataset discovery, exploration and reuse as well as helping data portal administrators in detecting and eliminating spam. However, such metadata information is currently very limited to a few data portals where they are usually provided manually, thus being often incomplete and inconsistent in terms of quality. To address these issues, we propose a scalable automatic approach for extracting, validating, correcting and generating descriptive linked dataset profiles. This approach applies several techniques in order to check the validity of the metadata provided and to generate descriptive and statistical information for a particular dataset or for an entire data portal.},

  title = {Agile and Lean Principles in the Humanitarian Supply Chain},
  volume = {2},
  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the specific stages of the humanitarian logistics process in which the agile and lean principles are needed. Design/methodology/approach - To achieve this purpose, the authors propose an original conceptual framework and apply it to evidence from a "best practice" case study in the humanitarian sector: the United Nations World Food Programme and its efforts in the Darfur (Sudan) crisis. Findings - Although several previous works introduced the agile principle as suitable for disaster relief, when and how to embrace the agile and lean principles remained unclear. This paper demonstrates the proper combination of the agile and lean principles in disaster relief phases. The correspondence is based on the coincidence of the objectives that arises in every stage and that each principle is capable of achieving. Research limitations/implications - Further empirical research is needed to support the framework and to enrich the results that arise from this first explorative work. Practical implications - The proposed framework is targeted at leading actors involved in the operation and planning of humanitarian logistics when a crisis emerges. This approach, which is based on the combination of the agile and lean principles, is not exclusive to the humanitarian sector. This perspective may be useful to create business logistics that address disruptions to traditional supply chain flows and other forces that disrupt logistics, production and information handling. Originality/value - The paper clarifies how agility and leanness should be emphasised in specific stages of the humanitarian logistics process, to reach a higher level of effectiveness and efficiency when planning disaster relief.},
